Hello, I am a Software Developer who loves to sleep and makes jokes :joy_cat: . I'm current studying Computer Science and Engineering from Chitkara University, Rajpura. :mortar_board:

My main field of interest is Web-based Development :globe_with_meridians: and I can make awesome looking webpages :computer: that are really cool very easily! In the world of Development where frameworks and tools evolve from day-to-day, it really doesn't matter what framework I use. What really matters is the willingness and grasping power to learn with the flow. And believe me I'm a really fast learner. :running: I try to go one step at a time which makes the whole concept of learning a total easy job and deep knowledge of the concepts.

Recently I have found a new field where I really enjoy to work, :heart_eyes: i.e Voice and AI. I have been working on designing and building Voice based solutions to many clients during my internship at <a href="https://govocal.ai">GoVocal.AI</a>. Currently I'm working with JavaScript, Angular, Java, Node.js and Firebase etc in building the Voice apps creating platform - <a href="https://govocal.ai">GoVocal.AI</a>. Some of the other important things that I'll include are C/C++, Git, Linux etc. :100:

I also work with Google's Flutter for Android and IOS Development and am looking forward to upgrade my skills for Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. :smile:

Here is one of my favourite quotes of all time:
